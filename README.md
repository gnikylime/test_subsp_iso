# Testing isomorphism between tuples of subspaces

Given two tuples of subspaces, or more precisely, orthonormal bases for those subspaces, can you tell whether the tuples are isomorphic? Some algorithms to test for isomorphism are posted here.

Code to compute an injective invariant (normalized Gram) for tuples in the Grassmannian of planes in R^d modulo O(d) given a Gram matrix of orthobases for those planes is 
Code to compute words which may be evaluated on a generated H^*-algebra to determine an injective invariant is 
Code to compute traces of the evaluated words to determine isomorphism of n-tuples of d× matrices generating H^∗-algebra here.
